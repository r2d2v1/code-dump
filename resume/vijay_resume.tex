\section{\textsc{Personal \newline Profile}}
My interests are in building fast and scalable information retrieval systems. I am currently the lead engineer at Bimaple, an UC Irvine based search-as-a-service startup. Previously, I was a graduate student in the Information Systems Group at UC Irvine. The most impressive thing that I have built so far is \htmladdnormallink{www.omniplaces.com}{http://omniplaces.com}. Besides Google Local, it is the only location based instant typo tolerant search engine on 17M US business listings on the web!
