EXPERIENCE
[1] Bimaple Technology,
www.bimaple.com
May 2010 - Present
Engineering lead in a three person tech startup started by UC Irvine Prof. Chen Li. Designed and built 4 iterations of a high performance instant search service product. Highlights are
a. Built from ground-up an in-memory instant typo-tolerant search engine in C++.
b. Optimized the engine for a mobile, location based application, leading to the first paying customer.
c. Designed and implemented a method to perform real-time sub-second index updates right into the search serving platform.   
d. Extended the above into a search-as-a-service product. www.omniplaces.com, www.bimaple.com/product

[2] Information Systems Group, University of California-Irvine
Graduate Researcher, Advisor: Prof.Chen Li

TECHNICAL SKILLS
Languages:    C, C++ (STL, Boost), Python, Javascript
Tools:        UNIX, AWS, cmake, gdb, libevent, pthreads, Message Queues, Map Reduce. 
I do not have any language or tool preference, although I learnt programming in C on UNIX. I am constantly looking for new hacks and I can pick up new ones rather quickly.
